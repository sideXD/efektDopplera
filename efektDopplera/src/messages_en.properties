menuHelpDescriptionDialog=<html><p style='text-align: justify;'>Dear user, here is a program simulating the Doppler effect.\n\nThe program allows you to experiment with various parameters, such as the velocity of the source, its position relative to the observer, and the frequency of the emitted sound. \nAfter entering the parameters, the program visualizes the Doppler effect simulation, presenting changes in the observed frequency. \nIt also provides the option to save collected data and graphs to files, as well as to change the source icon.\n\nHave fun!
